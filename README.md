AnkiAddon: Trashbin for Anki

## About:
This addon intercepts Anki's deletion process and redirects the selected note (and related cards) to a special filtered deck reserved for trash. Clicking on empty will empty the recycle bin. Clicking on delete while previewing the cards in the reviewer or browser will also purge it from the collection. To undelete, you have to bring up the browser and change decks. Needless to say, (but say I must) that this will not work on mobile or any non-desktop clients.
